## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
3 favorite apps and its features:
- Locket
  - pictures taken change in real time right on the widget in the home screen.
  - allows to share pictures to a specific person instead of everybody
- Lens Buddy
  - takes a number of pictures back to back, so you don't have to keep clicking
  - lets you choose the number
- Smart Tasks
  - good for homework or other tasks, has a checklist and can change the order
  - has a feature to put these in a widget so you can see them on your home screen
 
An app I would like to build is one that helps with everyday meals. It would randomly choose a recipe to make each day, whether it's breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner. I would like to add preferences and likes, like certain ingredients or cuisines, so the recipes that show up would be personalized to each user.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
There are many menus, options, and buttons, it gets overwhelming, especially if you can't find a certain option. It took me a while to find where the assistant was, and I still dont understand what the storyboard file is or where it was. I didn't do anything for the step that said to open that file.
